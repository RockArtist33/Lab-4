# Lab-4 - Cookie clicker type game
Lab 4 
A simple Pygame powered clicker game with the currency being money and you having to print as much as you can, becoming rich and owning a bunch of cash that you definetly leggally obtained. There were 3 people working on this and being our first collaborative projects everything was allover the place, but we managed to get a finilized version of the game which were all happy about, theres definetly more that can be added, but i'd say were all proud of this project/lab/assignment!
